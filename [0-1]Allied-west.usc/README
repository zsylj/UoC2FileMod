Victory in the West

西线大捷

Two small bugs need to be fixed

两个小bug需要修复

1. Code use regex to classify each unity type. And because my regex cannot cover all allied forces, especially the [ita_allied_43]

[id: 585] appears in [lombardy_liguria/units.yml] and [id: 723] appears in [liberation_of_bohemia/enroute_units.yml] 

2. Any scenario appears with [nz_arm_43], the [nz_arm_43] cannot be modified. 

The origianl unit should be [nz_inf_42] 

This was because they use an additional [unit_types.yml] file at [west.usc\fronts\italy\segments] change the [nz_inf_42] into [nz_arm_43] outside the DLC [units.yml] file.
